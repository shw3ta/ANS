# Asymmetrical Numeral Systems
This repo contains implementations of two variants of ANS based compression schemes: t-ANS or the tabled variant, and r-ANS, the range variant. The t-ANS implementation is from scratch and is naive, following a paper by Jarek Duda very closely. I have tried to incorporate several options into a later implementation to test out how well the tabled variant works in different scenarios such as adaptive frequency distribution building, pre-set distributions and so on. This repo will be updated as I understand more about ANS.
